# Final Project

Hey Team,

We’ve got an exciting opportunity to showcase a **generative music tool** at an important industry conference. This is a big deal for us, and I’m counting on your creativity and skills to make it unforgettable!

Your task is to create an **amazing generative music system** that can generate music in **semi-real-time**. What does this mean? I envision a Python program that continuously generates music, sends MIDI messages to a DAW, and uses virtual instruments or samples to sonify the output. The system should run indefinitely, generating new music on the fly.

## The Challenge
I’m giving you total creative freedom to decide:

* **What to build**: The type of generative music system.
* **How to build it**: The techniques and algorithms to use.

The goal is simple: create an **awesome generative AI music experience** that produces excellent and highly creative music.

Feel also free to use pre-trained Hugging Face models if you want.


Looking for some inspiration? Here are some ideas from previous years:

* **Liquiprism**: An implementation of the [Liquiprism Paper](https://www.icad.org/websiteV2.0/Conferences/ICAD2002/proceedings/36_AlanDorin.pdf)
  * [Live DAW integration](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/J_Kz7gld5D4)
  * [Web-based demo](https://liquiprism.vercel.app/)

Feel free to explore similar approaches or develop your own unique concept!

## Deliverables
Here’s what I need by the end of the sprint:

* **1. Code Repository:**
  * A repo containing the Python 3.10 program on GitHub Classroom
  * Please write clean, professional, and well-documented code, as it will be handed over to the production team for further development if needed.

* **2. 10-minute Presentation (live):**
  * Explain the system clearly (focus on making the explanation easy to follow)
  * Show the system in action
  * I want to see how it works and get a feel for the music it generates

## Stretch Goal (Optional)

If you’re feeling ambitious, consider adding user **interaction controls** to influence the generation process. For example:

* **Motion-based Interaction**: Movement influences note density.
* **Environmental Interaction**: Room temperature correlates with harmony dissonance.
* **User-interface**: A window with sliders & knobs, external MIDI controller support.

This isn’t required, but experimenting with these ideas could make the system even more impressive. Remember, the sky’s the limit!

## Deadlines

The final project is due by **February 16th** at midnight on GitHub Classroom
Your team will present on February 17th in class

## Final Notes
I’m confident this project will be a lot of fun and a chance to let your creativity shine. If you deliver a killer generative music system, it will grab attention at the conference and open doors for us all.

Make sure to collaborate effectively—leverage each team member’s unique skills in music, sound design, and tech.

Good luck, and let’s make something extraordinary!

Valerio, your CTO 🎵🚀
